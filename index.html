          <p class="description">Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane,<br /> ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements,<br /> as in the case of tourism. The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.</p>

      <p class="popular-description">A waterfall is any point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops. Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top layer of resistant bedrock before falling on to softer rock, which erodes faster, leading to an increasingly high fall.<br/> <br/> Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.Humans have had a distinct relationship with waterfalls for years, travelling to see them, exploring and naming them. They can present formidable barriers to navigation along rivers. Waterfalls are religious sites in many cultures.</p>
